		<p class='inleiding'><span class='firstcharacter'>I</span>n the following ‘visual reflection’ of the past few weeks of this minor I will highlight a few areas which appeal to me personally in the “quest” for a sustainable and a circular future. In in a mere 1000 words I can’t mention everything, so I selected the things that most apply to my field of study: Product Design in combination with the other disciplines <span class="italic">(Material Research, Digital Production and Business Modelling)</span>.</p>
		
		<div class='dot'></div><h3>Circularity and Sustainability</h3>

		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6g0AYbEoOGk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

		<p>The main motivation for the push towards a more sustainable future is the need for humanity to keep existing at its current <span class="italic">(or a better)</span> level of prosperity. The way our current linear economy works can’t be sustained indefinitely. If it continues a glass ceiling will be reached. The solution? A circular economy where all natural occurring resources can be reused forever. A future where where no waste is created and nothing is thrown away.</p>

		<p>In the documentary “Closing the Loop” we saw some great examples of companies feeding their waste products back into their factories. GM Ecuador, for example, uses a water filtration system to purify their waste water and make it potable again. The video above is linked to the exact moment of the section in the documentary.</p>

		<div class='dot'></div><h3>Robotic/Digital Production</h3>

		<p>A great method of recycling this produced waste is trough the means of digital and robotic production. In modern manufacturing all produced parts <span class="italic">(literally)</span> fit into the same mould. If a material doesn’t “fit” it can’t be used.</p>

		<div class="hannah" data-parallax="scroll" data-image-src="images/hannah.jpg" data-speed="0.6"></div>

		<p>If every stool of a certain product line has the exact dimensions, most waste wood can’t be used to produce it. Digital production and robotic scanning makes it possible for waste material to be used; a stool can be made out of many different pieces of wood. Not all stools will look exactly the same, but all waste material will be used. A good example of this production method is the "<a href="https://archello.com/project/ashen-cabin" target="_blank">Ashen Cabin</a>" by the “HANNAH Design Office”.</p>

		<div class="filter" data-parallax="scroll" data-image-src="images/filter.jpg" data-speed="0.6"></div>

		<p>During the disastrous Apollo 13 moon mission the astronauts found their cabin filled with high levels of  carbon dioxide. Mission Control back on earth gave them instructions on how to build a functional makeshift adapter <span class="italic">(seen left)</span> for the air filtration system made solely out of components found in the lunar module: hoses from spacesuits, duct tape, socks, a flight manual cover, etc. An app could be produced where people fill in waste stuff they have laying around and trough digital production means a list could be generated with possible products they can make out of the waste. This is only a small example of what is possible.</p>

		<div class='dot'></div><h3>‘Building to last’ and Serviceability</h3>

		<p>It’s important in the circular economy that 100% of waste can be reused and reintroduced into the supply chain. But ideally there is no waste at all and products can be used indefinitely. This is (for now) of course not possible. So one of the essential things for me in the the circular world, is that we should be building things to last as long as possible. That is, if 100% of material resources can’t be recycled into the economy, the main focus should be to build things to last as long as possible.</p>

		<div class="olympia" data-parallax="scroll" data-image-src="images/olympia.jpg" data-speed="0.6"></div>

		<p>So, allowing costumers to  cheaply repair their own products is absolutely essential. Even after a company goes out of business their products should still be serviceable. A very bad example of this is Apple. Apple makes it impossible for customers to repair their own products, all repairs have to be done by Apple at extremely high prices. Many people are more likely to buy a new phone than to repair their old one. Thus, creating more waste.</p>

		<p>It seems like many products of the past were built to last for a much longer period than today. Some of this can of course be ascribed to ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias" target="_blank">Survivorship Bias</a>’. An example I gave in class is the fully mechanical ‘Olympia SM3 Deluxe’ I own, which after seventy years and a quick oiling is still fully functional. You’d be lucky if your smartphone lasted a tenth of that time.</p>

		<div class='dot'></div><h3>Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic</h3>

		<p>The recent and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shown us that our current manufacturing process is highly dependent on global networks. If these networks cease to function as a consequent of a global lockdown most manufacturing stops dead in its tracks. In this situation multitudes of countries are unwilling to share their resources and manufacturing with the rest of the world. Most products we buy and use are made and sourced from all over the world; if the global supply chain is hindered it gets increasingly harder to keep producing these products. So, as much as globalisation has brought unprecedented levels of prosperity all over the world <span class="italic">(but mainly the west)</span>, it can fail to function.</p>

		<div class="corona" data-parallax="scroll" data-image-src="images/corona.gif" data-speed="0.6"></div>

		<p>One of the solutions is to add a level of local sourcing and manufacturing to the design process. This way the supply chain can keep functioning throughout a worldwide pandemic. This has the added benefit of giving companies a greater amount of control and knowledge over the origins of their resources. Many natural resources are unfortunately acquired by exploiting local populations in “third world” countries, this has to stop.</p>

		<p>Most cheap factory manufacturing of western products takes place in <span class="italic">(east)</span> Asian countries at near slavery wages and in inhumane conditions. This amoral process can be stopped if manufacturing returns to the country of origin at fair wages. All western consumers are partly responsible for an exploitative system at the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/05/business/worldbusiness/05sweatshop.html" target="_blank">other side of the world</a>. The Coronacrisis has shown the kind of problems it creates having manufacturing done in foreign countries; manufacturing locally has the added benefit of giving people fair wages because of The Netherlands' strict labour laws.</p>
